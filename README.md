# Smart Vehicle Tracking System for PUST

## Introduction
The Smart Campus Vehicle Tracking System is a mobile application designed to address the transportation challenges faced by students, faculty, and staff at Pabna University of Science and Technology (PUST). With a significant portion of the university population relying on campus buses for commuting, there have been issues regarding overcrowding and inefficiencies, leading to difficulties in attending classes and examinations.

To mitigate these challenges, we propose the development of a mobile application that will provide real-time tracking of campus buses, ensuring reliable and efficient transportation for students, faculty, and staff. This solution aims to improve accessibility, reduce waiting times, and enhance the overall campus experience.
